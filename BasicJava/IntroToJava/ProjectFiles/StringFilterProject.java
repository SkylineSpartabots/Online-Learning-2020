                B - Has the letter 'b' at index 2
                C - Contains the word "code" OR "java" within it
                D - Does not contain the vowel 'e'
                E - Has a length of over 6 AND below 12
                F - Is in all other buckets

            Hints:
            -Create some variables that store what is true about the string being tested (maybe change them from false to true within the if checks?)
            -You will need to use some operators (Remember: && || for booleans, < > == for ints)
            -This may seem daunting at first, but stick with it :)
            -ASK FOR HELP I WILL LITERALLY DROP WHAT IM DOING AND ASSIST YOU WITH YOUR CODE DON'T BE AFRAID TO DM ME <3 - Varun
