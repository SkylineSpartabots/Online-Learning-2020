        Create a program that can take in an integer, an operator, and another integer (separated by spaces)
        and return the sum of that operation.

        Example console log:
        ---
        Please input your operation: <- computer generated output
        5 + 5                        <- user input
        Result: 10                   <- computer generated output
        Thank you!                   <- computer generated output
        ---

        Make sure to be able to handle bad input and that your program will not crash. If bad input is given,
        the program should tell the user that their input is bad.

        Advanced: make a program that can chain together three numbers and possibly handle different operators
        (dont worry about PEMDAS)
